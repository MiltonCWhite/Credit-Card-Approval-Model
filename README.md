# Credit-Card-Approval-Model
Approval for a credit card application is a critical decision for financial institutes due to potential financial loss by the payment default. Approving a client for a credit card based on their personal information by a person is one of the most jeopardizing decisions for a bank. In this research project, I will build a Credit Card Approval Model to help banks make the right and fast decisions using machine learning techniques. The primary aim is to find the updated prediction model for the credit card approval decision. Along with finding out which features matter the most when determining if they would approve a client for a credit card or not.
